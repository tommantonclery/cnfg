# cnfg-derive

_Internal crate_: procedural macros that power [`cnfg`](https://crates.io/crates/cnfg).

The derive crate is not meant to be used directly. Depend on `cnfg` and the `Cnfg` derive will be re-exported for you:

```toml
[dependencies]
cnfg = "0.1.1"
```

See the [cnfg README](https://github.com/tommantonclery/cnfg) for complete documentation and examples.
